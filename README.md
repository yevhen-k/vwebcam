# VWebCam

VWebCam is the POC/draft project.

The main idea of the project is the application of different kinds of filters (both OpenCV and Deep Learning) to alter your web cam stream and make it possible to use custom filters (masks and backgounds) in Zoom and Google Meet both static and animated.

Example:

## Prerequesties
1. Install linux kernel headers for your kernel, for example, `linux510-headers`
2. Install `v4l2loopback-dkms`
3. Initialize loopback device as described in [docs](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback#options):
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 card_label="My Fake Webcam" exclusive_caps=1
   ls -l /dev/video*
   ```
   In my case `/dev/video2` was initialized
4. Start the app
5. Check if it works
   ```bash
   ffplay /dev/video2
   ```
   Window with web stream should appear.
6. After you're done:
   ```bash  
   sudo modprobe --remove v4l2loopback
   ```

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo
2. Make virtual environment and install requirements
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Make sure to follow [Prerequesties](#Prerequesties) paragraph
4. Edit [config.py](config.py) to met your settings
5. Start the app:
   ```bash
   python .
   ```

## TODOs
- [x] add margins to make better look and feel for thug mask
- [x] add rotations to the thug mask
- [x] add thug cigarette
- [x] implement virtual camera support
- [x] implemet gracefull quit
- [x] massive refactoring
- [x] hot reload: config update should automatically trigger update stream
- [ ] scale down input images to speed-up calculations (may make keypoint prediction more noisy)
- [ ] ability to add new images via config / gui
- [ ] use face [mesh](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html)
